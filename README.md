# Complete-ETL-pipeline-with-Data-cleaning-and-visualization-
A Python-based ETL workflow that extracts data from CSV, JSON, XML, and SQLite sources, cleans and transforms it (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, scaling, and feature engineering), and loads the final dataset into multiple formats. Includes clear visualizations to explore global demographic and economic trends.
This repository contains a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented in Python, designed to handle real-world datasets involving population, economic data, and project information from multiple file formats and databases.

## Key features of this project include:

Data Extraction from diverse sources including CSV, JSON, XML files, and SQLite databases.

Data Cleaning and Preparation techniques to handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize categories, parse dates, and map country codes.

Outlier Detection and Removal using statistical methods to improve data quality and analysis accuracy.

Feature Engineering to create new meaningful variables such as GDP per capita.

Data Scaling to normalize large and small numeric ranges for better comparison and modeling.

Loading Process saving clean, merged data into various formats for easy reuse.

Data Visualization using plots like scatterplots, boxplots, and regression analysis to uncover insights and relationships in the data.

### This project is ideal for students, data enthusiasts, and professionals who want to learn practical ETL workflows, data cleaning best practices, and visualization techniques
